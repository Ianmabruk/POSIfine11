# Backend API URL Configuration
# For development (Flask backend running locally)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5002

# For production (deployed backend)
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com

# JWT Secret (should match backend SECRET_KEY)
# JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-change-in-production

# Note: 
# - The frontend will automatically append /api to the URL
# - Make sure your Flask backend is running on port 5002 for development
# - For production, set VITE_API_URL to your deployed backend URL
